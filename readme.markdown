# Learn Python the Hard Way Excercises

Getting comfortable with the basics & syntax of python through repetition

#### Comparisons to ruby

The explicit use of parens when calling functions/function calls in python 3 is nice (Never liked missing parens in method calls/definitions)

String interpolation is different.

Functions are weird with no end and trailing colon after args

Feels a bit more like writing coffeescript than ruby.
